            Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! I am currently a student
            pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at Utah Tech
            University. I have lived in St. George, Utah my whole life and spend
            my free time snowboarding, hiking, and watching youbtube videos that teach me something. I have always been fascinated by
            technology and how it shapes our world.
            <br />
          </br>
            As a software engineering student, I have honed my skills in various
            programming languages such as Javascript, C++, C, HTML, CSS, SQL,
            Python. I am proud to say that I have maintained an above 3.9 major
            GPA throughout my Software Engineering degree, demonstrating my
            commitment to excellence and dedication to my studies.I am passionate
            about creating innovative solutions to complex problems and always
            strive to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends.
            <br />
          </br>
            Throughout my academic career, I have had the opportunity to work on
            various projects that have challenged me both technically and
            creatively. As a team leader, I have learned the importance of
            effective communication, collaboration, and delegation to ensure
            project success. I believe that my ability to work well in a team
            setting, coupled with my problem-solving skills, makes me an asset to
            any project or organization. This portfolio website is a showcase of
            my skills, achievements, and projects. 
            <br />
          </br>
            I hope to demonstrate my
            proficiency in software development and illustrate my creativity and
            problem-solving abilities. Thank you for taking the time to learn
            about me, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!
