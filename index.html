            Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! I am currently a student
            pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at Utah Tech
            University. I have lived in St. George, Utah my whole life and spend
            my free time snowboarding, hiking, and watching youtube videos that
            teach me new things. I have always been fascinated by technology and
            how it shapes our world.
            <br />
            <br />
            As a software engineering student, I have acquired a unique skillset
            that invloves various programming languages such as Javascript, C#,
            Swift, C++, C, HTML, CSS, SQL, Python. I am proud to say that I have
            maintained an above 3.8 major GPA throughout my Software Engineering
            career, demonstrating my commitment to excellence and dedication to
            my studies. I am passionate about creating innovative solutions to
            complex problems and always strive to stay up-to-date with the
            latest technologies and trends.
            <br />
            <br />
            Throughout my academic career, I have had the opportunity to work on
            various projects that have challenged me both technically and
            creatively. As a team leader, I have learned the importance of
            effective communication, collaboration, and delegation to ensure
            project success. I believe that my ability to work well in a team
            setting, coupled with my problem-solving skills, makes me an asset
            to any project or organization. This portfolio website is a showcase
            of my skills, achievements, and projects.
            <br />
            <br />
            I hope to demonstrate my proficiency in software development and
            illustrate my creativity and problem-solving abilities. Thank you
            for taking the time to learn about me, and I look forward to
            connecting with you soon!
